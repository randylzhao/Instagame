# Instagame
Instagame is an Android labyrinth game where the goal is to get a ball from one area to another area of the screen by tilting the phone. Unlike conventional labyrinth games that use predetermined mazes , Instagame creates the levels with pictures on your phone. Edges in your picture become the walls of the maze.
